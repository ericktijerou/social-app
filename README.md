## Libraries and tools used in the project

### Android

* [AndroidX](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx)
Artifacts within the androidx namespace comprise the Android Jetpack libraries. Like the Support Library, 
libraries in theandroidx namespace ship separately from the Android platform and provide backward compatibility 
across Android releases.
* [Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding)
Write declarative layouts and minimize the glue code necessary to bind application logic and layouts.
* [Android KTX](https://github.com/android/android-ktx)
A set of Kotlin extensions for Android app development.

### Architecture and Design

* [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/index.html)
Android architecture components are a collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps. 
Start with classes for managing your UI component lifecycle and handling data persistence.
* [Koin](https://insert-koin.io/)
A pragmatic lightweight dependency injection framework for Kotlin developers. Written in pure Kotlin using functional 
resolution only: no proxy, no code generation, no reflection!
* [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html)
Asynchronous or non-blocking programming is the new reality. Whether we're creating server-side, desktop or mobile applications, 
it's important that we provide an experience that is not only fluid from the user's perspective, but scalable when needed.

### View and Image

* [ConstraintLayout](https://developer.android.com/training/constraint-layout/index.html)
Allows you to create large and complex layouts with a flat view hierarchy (no nested view groups).
* [RecyclerView](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/RecyclerView.html)
A flexible view for providing a limited window into a large data set.
* [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide)
An image loading and caching library for Android focused on smooth scrolling

### Data Request

* [Retrofit](http://square.github.io/retrofit/)
A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.
* [OkHttp](http://square.github.io/okhttp/)
An HTTP & HTTP/2 client for Android and Java applications.

### Persistence

* [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room.html)
The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.

### Others technologies & methodologies which used:
* [Gradle Kotlin DSL](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html)
Gradleâ€™s Kotlin DSL provides an alternative syntax to the traditional Groovy DSL with an enhanced editing experience in supported IDEs, with superior content assist, 
refactoring, documentation, and more. This chapter provides details of the main Kotlin DSL constructs and how to use it to interact with the Gradle API.
* [LeakCanary](https://square.github.io/leakcanary/)
LeakCanary is a memory leak detection library for Android.
